# Used Cars - Data Engineering

This project, carried out as part of Big Data Engineering course, aims to obtain, analyze and process this dataset in order to find relevant information and patterns from the data, or implement o ML pipeline for some predictive purpose. The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data).

## Abstract
Determining the listed price of a used car is a chal- lenging task, due to the many factors that drive a used vehicle’s price on the market. The focus of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. The implementation and evaluation of several learning methods was carried out on a dataset that consists on the sale prices of different makes and models across cities in the United States. This study compares the performance of Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Isotonic Regression, Factorization Machines Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Grandient Boosting and Generalized Linear Regression in predicting the price of used cars. Our results show that with the increase in the dataset size, there was an increase in CPU usage in order to maintain a balance in task’s execution time. An increase in the number of workers does not always contribute to an improvement in results.
